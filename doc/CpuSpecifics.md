# CPU specific details

# 6502

## Section alignment
Sections are not aligned to any particular multiple.

## Command line

### -mu\<x> option
Some versions of the 6502 series have a number of undocumented instructions. As they are undocumented, no official mnemonics exist. Several sets of mnemonics are in use, however. These can be selected with the ```-mu<x>``` option, where x is 0 (no undocumented opcodes), 1, 2 or 3.

| Set #1 | Set #2 | Set #3 |
|---|---|---|
| AAC | ANC | ANC |
| AAX | SAX | AXS |
| ARR | ARR | ARR |
| ASR | ASR | ALR |
| ATX | LXA | OAL |
| AXA | SHA | AXA |

|---|---|---|---|
| Define data | DB | DW | |
| Define space | DS | | |
| Reserve symbol | RB | RW | |

# Z80
## Section alignment
Sections are not aligned to any particular multiple.

## Numeric formats
The Z80 backend supports an additional numeric literal format. The first character is the backtick:

```
`00112233
```

The values are pixel values. The values are converted from chunky data format to the planar format used by the Game Boy.

## Command line
### -mg\<ASCI> option
The ```-mg``` option can be used to change the four characters used for Game Boy graphic literals.

### -mc\<x> option
This option is used to select the CPU type. The default is Z80.

| x | CPU type |
|---|---|
| g | Gameboy |
| z | Z80 (default) |

### -ms<x> option
This option enables certain synthesized instructions.

| x | Synthesized instructions |
|---|---|
| 0 | Disabled |
| 1 | Enabled |

Synthesized instructions are safe sequences with no unintended side effects. These can be used to improve
readabilility of source code.

| Mnemonic | Notes |
|---|---|
| LD reg16,reg16 | reg16 = BC, DE or HL |
| LD ireg,reg16 | ireg = IX or IY, reg16 = BC or DE - needs undocumented instructions enabled |
| LD reg16,ireg | ireg = IX or IY, reg16 = BC or DE - needs undocumented instructions enabled |
| LD reg16,(ireg+n8) | reg16 = BC, DE or HL, ireg = IX or IY |

# M68K

## Register tracking

The M68K assembler will keep track of the registers that operations have modified. This is tracked in a variable named `__USED_REGMASK` where each bit corresponds to a register (bit 15 is A7 down to bit 0 which is D0). The current register mask can be reset with the `REGMASKRESET`. Additional registers can be added to `__USED_REGMASK` using the `REGMASKADD` directive.

## Instruction extensions

The `MOVEM` instruction may receive a bitmask literal instead of a register list

```
	movem.l	(sp)+,#$000F	; pop d0-d3
```

## Section alignment
Sections are aligned to a multiple of 8 bytes. 

## Command line
### -mc\<x> option
This option is used to select the CPU type. The default is 68000.

| x | CPU type |
|---|---|
| 0 | 68000 (default) |
| 1 | 68010 |
| 2 | 68020 |
| 3 | 68030 |
| 4 | 68040 |
| 6 | 68060 |

## __DCB, __RS, __DSB

|| 8 bit | 16 bit | 32 bit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Define data | DC.B | DC.W | DC.L |
| Define space | DS.B | DS.W | DS.L |
| Reserve symbol | RS.B | RS.W | RS.L |

## Section types
The Amiga has two types of memory - "chip" memory and non-chip (sometimes called "fast" memory). The assembler supports three additional section types, that will placed the section into chip memory. These are ```CODE_C```, ```DATA_C``` and ```BSS_C```, which correspond to ```CODE```, ```DATA``` and ```BSS``` respectively.

## Functions
The M68K assembler supports an additional function that may be used in expressions.

| Function | Meaning |
|---|---|
| regmask | [Bit mask](Expressions.md#m68k) of register list |

## Directives

| Directive | Meaning |
|---|---|
| mc68000 | Enable only 68000 instructions |
| mc68010 | Enable only 68010 instructions |
| mc68020 | Enable only 68020 instructions |
| mc68030 | Enable only 68030 instructions |
| mc68040 | Enable only 68040 instructions |
| mc68060 | Enable only 68060 instructions |
| regmaskreset | Reset the currently tracked registers in `__USED_REGMASK` |
| regmaskadd | Add a register bitmask to the tracked registers in `__USED_REGMASK` |


# SCHIP
CHIP-8 and SCHIP have no officially defined mnemonics. ASMotor uses a set of mnemonics that is similar to other ISA's and should be easy to learn.

## Section alignment
Sections are not aligned to any particular multiple.

## Registers
The registers are named ```V0``` to ```VF```. ```VA``` to ```VF``` may also be referred to as ```V10``` to ```V15```

# DCPU-16
0x10C was a game that was going to feature a user programmable fantasy CPU, the DCPU-16. ASMotor supports assembling code for this CPU.

DCPU-16 specifications can be [found here](https://gist.github.com/metaphox/3888117).

## Word size
This CPU is a little different in that its native word size is 16 bit and it's unable to address individual bytes.

## Section alignment
Sections are aligned to native 16 bit words.

## Command line
### -mo\<x>
This option controls the level of optimization. 0 means no optimization, while 1 will optimize addressing modes to use shorter forms when possible.
