# Diagnostic messages
While assembling it is possible to cause the assembler to print out various user defined messages.

Simple diagnostic messages are possible with ```PRINTT```, ```PRINTF``` and ```PRINTV```.

```
PRINTT "A simple message\n" ; Remember \n for newline
PRINTV (2+3)/5              ; Prints an integer
PRINTF 3.14**2              ; Prints a fixed point value
```

See also ["string literals"](Expressions.md#string_literals) for more advanced formatting options.

In macros it can be helpful to warn the user of a wrong argument or completely abort the assembly process. This is possible with the ```FAIL``` and ```WARN``` commands. ```FAIL``` and ```WARN``` take a string as the only argument and will print it out as a regular warning or error with a line number.

```FAIL``` stops assembling immediately while WARN continues after printing the error message.

```
IF (\1)<42
WARN "Argument should be >= 42"
ENDC

IF (\1)>100
FAIL "Argument MUST be <= 100"
ENDC
```
